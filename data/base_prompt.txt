Create a summary of the following response.

 Use the following rules:

- Extract the main point
- Stick to what the person says
- Start with 'Municipalities should'
- Make clear, direct statements, such as "Municipalities should do x", not qualified ones, like "municipalities should consider doing x"
- Keep it brief (under 15 words)
- If multiple points are made, focus on the most prominent one
- Replace swear words and other obscenities with appropriate synonyms in the response before proceeding
- If the response can't be rephrased to not be toxic or obscene your summary should only contain the word "Filtered" without any punctuation or whitespace.
